### 2.5 Open Questions

**Technical Integration Questions:**
1. **Odoo Webhook Security:** What HMAC algorithm and key rotation strategy should be implemented for webhook signature verification?
2. **Commission Calculation Timing:** Should commissions be calculated on invoice creation, posting, or payment completion in Odoo?
3. **Data Synchronization:** How should the system handle network failures during Odoo webhook processing? (Retry logic, dead letter queues)
4. **Performance Optimization:** What caching strategy should be implemented for frequently accessed affiliate data and commission calculations?

**Business Logic Clarifications:**
1. **Attribution Conflicts:** How should the system handle cases where a customer uses both a referral key and matches an email lead from different affiliates?
2. **Commission Reversals:** What is the process for handling partial refunds? Should commissions be proportionally reduced or fully reversed?
3. **Tier Evaluation:** Should tier calculations be based on calendar months or rolling 30-day periods?
4. **Fraud Detection:** What specific thresholds and patterns should trigger automatic affiliate account flags for review?

**Compliance and Legal:**
1. **Data Privacy:** What GDPR/CCPA compliance measures are required for email lead capture and processing?
2. **Tax Reporting:** What tax documentation and reporting features are needed for affiliate commission payments?
3. **Terms of Service:** What affiliate agreement terms need to be enforced through the system?

**Scalability Concerns:**
1. **Database Performance:** At what affiliate count should database partitioning or sharding be considered?
2. **Email Delivery:** What fallback mechanisms are needed if primary email service provider fails?
3. **Analytics Processing:** Should real-time analytics be moved to a separate data warehouse for large datasets?

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Testing Strategy

#### 5.1.1 Unit Testing Requirements

**Code Coverage Target:** 90% minimum coverage  
**Testing Framework:** PHPUnit for Laravel backend  
**Key Areas for Unit Testing:**

**Commission Calculation Logic:**
```php
// Test scenarios for commission calculations
public function testL1CommissionCalculation()
{
    $sale = ['subtotal' => 1000.00];
    $commission = CommissionService::calculateL1($sale);
    $this->assertEquals(47.50, $commission); // 5% of 95% (after discount)
}

public function testMultiLevelCommissionSplit()
{
    $affiliate = $this->createAffiliateWithReferrer(3); // 3 levels deep
    $splits = CommissionService::calculateForInvoice($invoice, $affiliate);
    $this->assertCount(3, $splits);
    $this->assertEquals('5.0', $splits[0]['rate']); // L1: 5%
    $this->assertEquals('1.0', $splits[1]['rate']); // L2: 1%
    $this->assertEquals('0.5', $splits[2]['rate']); // L3: 0.5%
}
```

**Referral Key Generation:**
```php
public function testReferralKeyUniqueness()
{
    $keys = [];
    for ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++) {
        $key = ReferralKeyService::generate();
        $this->assertNotContains($key, $keys);
        $keys[] = $key;
    }
}
```

**Email Lead Processing:**
```php
public function testLeadConfirmationWindow()
{
    $lead = EmailLead::factory()->create(['expires_at' => now()->addDays(60)]);
    $this->assertTrue($lead->isWithinAttributionWindow());
    
    $expiredLead = EmailLead::factory()->create(['expires_at' => now()->subDay()]);
    $this->assertFalse($expiredLead->isWithinAttributionWindow());
}
```

#### 5.1.2 Integration Testing

**Odoo Webhook Integration:**
```php
public function testOdooWebhookProcessing()
{
    $payload = [
        'event_type' => 'invoice.posted',
        'data' => [
            'odoo_invoice_id' => 'INV/2024/TEST',
            'subtotal' => 1000.00,
            'affiliate_key' => 'TESTKEY1',
            'customer_email' => 'test@example.com'
        ]
    ];
    
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/integrations/odoo/webhook', $payload);
    $response->assertStatus(200);
    
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('sales', [
        'odoo_invoice_id' => 'INV/2024/TEST',
        'sale_amount' => 1000.00
    ]);
}
```

**Email Service Integration:**
```php
public function testWelcomeEmailSending()
{
    Mail::fake();
    
    $affiliate = User::factory()->create(['role' => 'affiliate']);
    
    Mail::assertSent(AffiliateWelcomeEmail::class, function ($mail) use ($affiliate) {
        return $mail->hasTo($affiliate->email);
    });
}
```

#### 5.1.3 End-to-End Testing

**User Journey Tests:**
1. **Affiliate Registration Flow:**
   - User signs up → Email verification → Referral key generated → Welcome email sent
2. **Referral Attribution Flow:**
